### Overview
**Karaoke Maker** is an audio processing application developed in **MATLAB**. This project was created in 2018 and aims to eliminate human vocals from an audio file while keeping the music intact. By using various filters and amplifiers, the project isolates and processes the audio to create karaoke tracks.

### Features
- **Programming Language**: MATLAB
- **Functionality**: Removes human vocals from audio files, retaining the background music.
- **Audio Processing**: Leverages different filters and amplifiers to isolate and modify the audio signal for vocal removal.

### How It Works
The project uses a combination of signal processing techniques such as:
- **High-pass/Low-pass filters**: To isolate specific frequency ranges.
- **Amplifiers**: To modify the amplitude of the audio, ensuring music remains clear while vocals are diminished.
